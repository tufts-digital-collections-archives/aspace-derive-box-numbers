# ASpace Derive Box-numbers

A script for deriving box-numbers from archival object component identifiers, and some associated scripts and SQL queries.  This README covers the `map_box_numbers.py` script exclusively; the SQL docs in ```db_queries``` and other scripts are ephemera, left as an excercise to the reader.

This script's operation is specifically keyed to details of Tufts University's data, and should not be taken as a general means of mapping component IDs to box numbers.

## Requirements

The requirements for this script are listed in [Pipfile](https://github.com/tufts-digital-collections-archives/aspace-derive-box-numbers/blob/master/Pipfile).  If you're using [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) to manage dependencies, you can install them by running:

```
pipenv install
```

And run the script as:

```
pipenv run map_box_numbers.py ARGUMENTS
```

Alternatively, you can also install dependencies from the provided `requirements.txt` file.

Additionally, you will need to configure ArchivesSnake via a YAML configuration file as per the instructions [here](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake/#configuration), providing a base url, username, and password for a user that has the ability to edit and create repository records. (The script assumes a single repository with id = 2.)  You will also need to provide database access to the MySQL database of your ArchivesSpace instance.  Host name, user, and database name can be passed in as arguments to the script, but you will be prompted to input the password, as it is not secure to include it within the command.

## Operation

If run without the `--commit` argument, the script will produce two files: a report on the disposition of top_containers (`proposed_box_numbers.csv`) and a report on containers converted to digital objects (`digital_object_conversion.csv`); no changes will be made to your ArchivesSpace data.  By adding `--commit`, the script will:
1. Generate the reports,
2. Change the indicators of boxes, and
3. Convert boxes whose barcodes indicate they are supposed to be digital objects.

Additionally, a log will be produced, by default at `map_box_numbers.log`. This log is formatted as JSON Lines, i.e. a single JSON object per line.
